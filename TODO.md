# TODO

Change sway theming (window borders)
* Font support (kitty is missing some characters even in the prefix)

Theme tuigreet (colours are wrong, perhaps a small source change could render images next to the main UI?)
Animated background for sway, opacity also would be good
Startup functions for note taking, sway cheatsheets (it's been a while) could be handy

Could be fun to theme hyprland? :p
Pride cursors!!
